# Hydro
 A compiled programming language similar to Python in syntax.

# How to run
1. Download/Install the jdk-19 (may work for other versions)
2. Either run the .exe file in the 'out' directory or run the .jar files in the 'out/artifacts' folder.
3. (if you run the .jar files) run `java -jar out/artifacts/Hydro_jar/Hydro.jar file` (replace file with a hydro file)

### Hydro is slower than python
