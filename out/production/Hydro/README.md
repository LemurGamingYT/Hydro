# Hydro
An interpreted programming language similar to Python & Carbon in syntax.

# How to run
1. Install jdk-19 (I used jdk-19, but it may work on others, don't know)
2. Add the java development kit to your PATH environment variable with the value `path\to\jdk\bin\`, normally it will be `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin` on windows
3. From a terminal, run: `java -jar out/artifacts/Hydro_jar/Hydro.jar [file]` (replace [file] with the file you want to interpret)
   Yay!
